              I am currently studying a Bachelors Degree, with honors, in Business Management at
              Canterbury Christ Church University, Birmingham Campus.<br /> In addition to this i have also purchased and
              am working through "The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu",
              through Udemy.<br />
              Furthermore, completing the Netcom course has given me access to a stackable CompTIA course.<br />
              This course leads to four qualifications, 1001, 1002, Network+ and Security+.<br />
              I intend to have completed the course and gained all four qualifications within 18 months.
