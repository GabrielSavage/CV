          <P>
            Starting <span style="color:red"> December 2020</span> i took the first step on the journey into IT. Beginning with an introduction to IT fundamentals, i completed the course and gained certification in four areas. My next step was a course in HTML and CSS, again i passed and gained a Microsoft
            qualification. At this point i hoped that i had learned enough fundamentals to land a job in the IT sector but have failed to be invited to interview for any of the jobs i have applied for. As this is somewhat of a stumbling block i have carried out
            some further research and purchased a course, from Udemy, to build up fundamentals in other areas and am in the process of creating and building up this site to act as my CV and highlight what i know so far.

            Here i am going to emphasize that this list is by no means exhaustive. I have worked in several industries over the years and have gained plenty of skills and experience along the way.
            My education and work experience will highlight this for you. I have listed all my IT skills, to start with, i personally feel that this is an impressive list considering i had <span style="color:red">no IT knowledge 9 months ago</span>.
            This is my attitude to everything i tackle in life.
            If i have caught your attention by now then i hope that by viewing the main CV areas of my site that you will develop a better understanding of how hard i work and how much i have put into IT so far.
            You will find the <span style="color:red">navigation area</span> for the CV content at the bottom of this page.
            Feel free to go through the <a title="This link will take you to a different part of my site, the CV navigation is below" href="details.html">detailed sections</a> in order to gain even more insight to my skills.
